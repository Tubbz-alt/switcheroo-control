Description: D-Bus service to check the availability of dual-GPU
 For systems that have both an integrated GPU and a dedicated GPU, this
 package by default will force the integrated GPU to be used to save power.
 .
 You can launch individual apps using the dedicated GPU by running them
 with the environment variable DRI_PRIME=1. Or you can right-click on the
 app (while it's not running) in GNOME Shell's Activities Overview
 and choose the "Launch using Dedicated Graphics Card" option.
 .
 If this default behavior is not appropriate, uninstall this package or
 set xdg.force_integrated=0 as a kernel command-line option in your
 bootloader.
