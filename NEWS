This release adds a number of new properties to list GPUs, figure out
how to launch OpenGL client on specific GPUs, and figure out which
one is the default, in a way that supports the stock GPU drivers as well
as the NVidia proprietary drivers.

The service file itself also makes use of systemd's hardening features.

Note that the API was extended in a backwards compatible way.
